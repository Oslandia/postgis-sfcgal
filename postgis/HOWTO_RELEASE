How to release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Date: 2009-07-01

Versioning Scheme
-----------------

Release version is composed by POSTGIS_MAJOR_VERSION, POSTGIS_MINOR_VERSION
and POSTGIS_MICRO_VERSION components.

By default only [POSTGIS_MICRO_VERSION] increments between releases.

[POSTGIS_MINOR_VERSION] is incremented (and MICRO set to 0) when minor
additions have been introduced (one or two functions can be considered
*micro* additions)

[POSTGIS_MAJOR_VERSION] is incremented (and MICRO and MINOR set to 0) when
a dump/reload of existing spatial databases is *REQUIRED* for things
to work or rather *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED* to get new functionalities.

Requirements
------------

In order to build a release, you will need to build PostGIS and the 
documentation -- that means having the required software:

* For PostGIS:
  - PostgreSQL 
  - GEOS
  - Proj4
* For the docs:
  - xsltproc
  - DocBook XSL scripts
  - ImageMagick
